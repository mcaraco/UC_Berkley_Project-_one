"NOTE: The substate, state, and census region estimates along with the 95 percent confidence (credible) intervals are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and are generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Map Group"" can be used to distinguish substate regions included in the maps from other substate regions. In the ""Map Group"" column, a ""1"" represents the national estimate, a ""2"" represents the census region estimates, a ""3"" represents the state-level estimates, a ""4"" represents the substate/aggregate region-level estimates included in the maps, and a ""5"" represents the other substate/aggregate region-level estimates that are not included in the maps.",,,,,,

"Table 8. Tobacco Product Use in the Past Month among Individuals Aged 12 or Older, by State and Substate Region: Percentages, Annual Averages Based on 2014, 2015, and 2016 NSDUHs",,,,,,
"NOTE: Tobacco Products include cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (i.e., snuff, dip, chewing tobacco or ""snus""), cigars, or pipe tobacco.",,,,,,
"NOTE: For substate region definitions, see the ""2014-2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health Substate Region Definitions"" at https://www.samhsa.gov/data/.",,,,,,
"NOTE: The substate, state, and census region estimates along with the 95 percent confidence (credible) intervals are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and are generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Map Group"" can be used to distinguish substate regions included in the maps from other substate regions. In the ""Map Group"" column, a ""1"" represents the national estimate, a ""2"" represents the census region estimates, a ""3"" represents the state-level estimates, a ""4"" represents the substate/aggregate region-level estimates included in the maps, and a ""5"" represents the other substate/aggregate region-level estimates that are not included in the maps.",,,,,,
